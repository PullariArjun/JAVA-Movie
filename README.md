# Java Movie System

## Overview:
The Java Movie System is a desktop application designed to manage a movie library, allowing users to explore, search, and organize their collection of movies. This system provides an intuitive interface to browse through various movies, view details, and manage movie-related data efficiently. The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Java programming, object-oriented principles, and GUI development.

## Movie Database Management:
---------------------------
- **Add Movies**: Users can add new movies to the database, including details such as title, genre, release year, director, and cast.
- **Edit Movies**: Existing movie records can be updated to ensure that the data remains current.
- **Delete Movies**: Users can remove movies that are no longer needed in the collection.
- **Search Movies**: Powerful search functionality to find movies based on various criteria like title, genre, or year of release.

## Data Persistence:
----------------
- **Database Integration**: For advanced implementations, the system is integrated with a relational database like MySQL for robust data storage and retrieval.

## Project Challenges:
-------------------
- **Handling Large Data Sets**: Managing and optimizing performance for large movie databases.
- **User Interface Design**: Creating a user-friendly interface that is both functional and visually appealing.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensuring that movie data is reliably stored and retrieved, with the ability to handle different storage formats.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Implementing efficient sorting and filtering algorithms to allow for quick navigation through the movie collection.

## Technologies Used:
---------------------
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Data Storage**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
